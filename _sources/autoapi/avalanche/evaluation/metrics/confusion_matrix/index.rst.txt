   Bases: :class:`avalanche.evaluation.abstract_metric.AbstractMetric`

   The Confusion Matrix metric.

   This matrix logs the Tensor and PIL Image representing the confusion
   matrix after each epoch.

   This metric is computed separately for each task.

   By default this metric computes the matrix on the test set only but this
   behaviour can be changed by passing train=True in the constructor.

   Creates an instance of the Confusion Matrix metric.

   The train and test parameters can be True at the same time. However,
   at least one of them must be True.

   :param train: When True, the metric will be computed on the training
       phase. Defaults to False.
   :param test: When True, the metric will be computed on the test
       phase. Defaults to True.
   :param num_classes: When not None, is used to properly define the
       amount of rows/columns in the confusion matrix. When None, the
       matrix will have many rows/columns as the maximum value of the
       predicted and true pattern labels. Defaults to None.
   :param normalize: Normalizes confusion matrix over the true (rows),
       predicted (columns) conditions or all the population. If None,
       confusion matrix will not be normalized. Valid values are: 'true',
       'pred' and 'all'.
   :param save_image: If True, a graphical representation of the confusion
       matrix will be logged, too. If False, only the Tensor representation
       will be logged. Defaults to True.
   :param image_creator: A callable that, given the tensor representation
       of the confusion matrix, returns a graphical representation of the
       matrix as a PIL Image. Defaults to `default_cm_image_creator`.
