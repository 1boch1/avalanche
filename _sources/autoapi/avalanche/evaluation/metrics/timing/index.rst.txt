.. py:class:: EpochTime(*, train=True, test=False)

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.evaluation.abstract_metric.AbstractMetric`

   Time usage metric, measured in seconds.

   The time is measured between the start and end of an epoch.

   Beware that this metric logs a time value for each epoch! For the average
   epoch time use :class:`AverageEpochTime` instead, which logs the average
   the average epoch time for each step.

   By default this metric takes the time on training epochs only but this
   behaviour can be changed by passing test=True in the constructor.

   Creates an instance of the Epoch Time metric.

   The train and test parameters can be True at the same time. However,
   at least one of them must be True.

   :param train: When True, the time will be taken on training epochs.
       Defaults to True.
   :param test: When True, the time will be taken on test epochs.
       Defaults to False.

.. py:class:: AverageEpochTime(*, train=True, test=False)

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.evaluation.abstract_metric.AbstractMetric`

   Time usage metric, measured in seconds.

   The time is measured as the average epoch time of a step.
   The average value is computed and emitted at the end of the train/test step.

   By default this metric takes the time of epochs in training steps only. This
   behaviour can be changed by passing test=True in the constructor.

   Consider that, when used on the test set, the epoch time is the same as the
   step time. This means that this metric and the :class:`EpochTime` metric
   will emit the same values when used for the test phase.

   Creates an instance of the Average Epoch Time metric.

   The train and test parameters can be True at the same time. However,
   at least one of them must be True.

   :param train: When True, the time will be taken on training epochs.
       Defaults to True.
   :param test: When True, the time will be taken on test epochs.
       Defaults to False.
