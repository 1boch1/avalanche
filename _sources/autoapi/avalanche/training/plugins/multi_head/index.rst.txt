.. py:class:: MultiHeadPlugin(model, classifier_field: str = 'classifier', keep_initial_layer=False)

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.training.plugins.strategy_plugin.StrategyPlugin`

   Base class for strategy plugins. Implements all the callbacks required
   by the BaseStrategy with an empty function. Subclasses must override
   the callbacks.

   MultiHeadPlugin manages a multi-head readout for multi-task
   scenarios and single-head adaptation for incremental tasks.
   The plugin automatically set the correct output head when the task
   changes and adds new heads when a novel task is encountered.
   This plugin *needs task identities* for multi-task scenarios.
   It does not need task identities for single incremental tasks
   (e.g. class incremental).

   By default, a Linear (fully connected) layer is created
   with as many output units as the number of classes in that task. This
   behaviour can be changed by overriding the "create_task_layer" method.

   By default, weights are initialized using the Linear class default
   initialization. This behaviour can be changed by overriding the
   "initialize_new_task_layer" method.

   When dealing with a Single-Incremental-Task scenario, the final layer
   may get dynamically expanded. By default, the initialization provided by
   the Linear class is used and then weights of already existing classes
   are copied (that  is, without adapting the weights of new classes).
   The user can control how the new weights are initialized by overriding
   "initialize_dynamically_expanded_head".

   :param model: PyTorch model
   :param classifier_field: field of the last layer of model.
   :param keep_initial_layer: if True keeps the initial layer for task 0.

   .. method:: before_training_iteration(self, strategy, **kwargs)


   .. method:: before_eval_iteration(self, strategy, **kwargs)


   .. method:: set_task_layer(self, strategy, experience: Experience)

      Sets the correct task layer. Creates a new head for previously
      unseen tasks.

      :param strategy: the CL strategy.
      :param experience: the experience info object.
      :return: None


   .. method:: create_task_layer(self, n_output_units: int, previous_task_layer=None)

      Creates a new task layer.

      By default, this method will create a new :class:`Linear` layer with
      n_output_units" output units. If  "previous_task_layer" is None,
      the name of the classifier field is used to retrieve the amount of
      input features.

      This method will also be used to create a new layer when expanding
      an existing task head.

      This method can be overridden by the user so that a layer different
      from :class:`Linear` can be created.

      :param n_output_units: The number of output units.
      :param previous_task_layer: If not None, the previously created layer
           for the same task.
      :return: The new layer.


   .. method:: initialize_new_task_layer(self, new_layer: Module)

      Initializes a new head.

      This usually is just a weight initialization procedure, but more
      complex operations can be done as well.

      The head can be either a new layer created for a previously
      unseen task or a layer created to expand an existing task layer. In the
      latter case, the user can define a specific weight initialization
      procedure for the expanded part of the head by overriding the
      "initialize_dynamically_expanded_head" method.

      By default, if no custom implementation is provided, no specific
      initialization is done, which means that the default initialization
      provided by the :class:`Linear` class is used.

      :param new_layer: The new layer to adapt.
      :return: None


   .. method:: initialize_dynamically_expanded_head(self, prev_task_layer, new_task_layer)

      Initializes head weights for enw classes.

      This function is called by "adapt_task_layer" only.

      Defaults to no-op, which uses the initialization provided
      by "initialize_new_task_layer" (already called by "adapt_task_layer").

      This method should initialize the weights for new classes. However,
      if the strategy dictates it, this may be the perfect place to adapt
      weights of previous classes, too.

      :param prev_task_layer: New previous, not expanded, task layer.
      :param new_task_layer: The new task layer, with weights from already
          existing classes already set.
      :return:


   .. method:: adapt_task_layer(self, prev_task_layer, new_task_layer)

      Adapts the task layer by copying previous weights to the new layer and
      by calling "initialize_dynamically_expanded_head".

      This method is called by "expand_task_layer" only if a new task layer
      was created as the result of encountering a new class for that task.

      :param prev_task_layer: The previous task later.
      :param new_task_layer: The new task layer.
      :return: None.


   .. method:: expand_task_layer(self, strategy, min_n_output_units: int, task_layer)

      Expands an existing task layer.

      This method checks if the layer for a task should be expanded to
      accommodate for "min_n_output_units" output units. If the task layer
      already contains a sufficient amount of output units, no operations are
      done and "task_layer" will be returned as-is.

      If an expansion is needed, "create_task_layer" will be used to create
      a new layer and then "adapt_task_layer" will be called to copy the
      weights of already seen classes and to initialize the weights
      for the expanded part of the layer.

      :param strategy: CL strategy.
      :param min_n_output_units: The number of required output units.
      :param task_layer: The previous task layer.

      :return: The new layer for the task.
