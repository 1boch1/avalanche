.. py:class:: NCScenario(train_dataset: TrainSetWithTargets, test_dataset: TestSetWithTargets, n_steps: int, task_labels: bool, shuffle: bool = True, seed: Optional[int] = None, fixed_class_order: Optional[Sequence[int]] = None, per_step_classes: Optional[Dict[int, int]] = None, class_ids_from_zero_from_first_step: bool = False, class_ids_from_zero_in_each_step: bool = False, reproducibility_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None)

   Bases: :class:`GenericCLScenario[TrainSetWithTargets, TestSetWithTargets, 'NCStepInfo']`, :class:`Generic[TrainSetWithTargets, TestSetWithTargets]`

   This class defines a "New Classes" scenario. Once created, an instance
   of this class can be iterated in order to obtain the step sequence
   under the form of instances of :class:`NCStepInfo`.

   This class can be used directly. However, we recommend using facilities like
   :func:`avalanche.benchmarks.generators.NCBenchmark`.

   Creates a ``NCGenericScenario`` instance given the training and test
   Datasets and the number of steps.

   By default, the number of classes will be automatically detected by
   looking at the training Dataset ``targets`` field. Classes will be
   uniformly distributed across ``n_steps`` unless a ``per_step_classes``
   argument is specified.

   The number of classes must be divisible without remainder by the number
   of steps. This also applies when the ``per_step_classes`` argument is
   not None.

   :param train_dataset: The training dataset. The dataset must contain a
       ``targets`` field. For instance, one can safely use the datasets
       from the torchvision package.
   :param test_dataset: The test dataset. The dataset must contain a
       ``targets`` field. For instance, one can safely use the datasets
       from the torchvision package.
   :param n_steps: The number of steps.
   :param task_labels: If True, each step will have an ascending task
       label. If False, the task label will be 0 for all the steps.
   :param shuffle: If True, the class order will be shuffled. Defaults to
       True.
   :param seed: If shuffle is True and seed is not None, the class order
       will be shuffled according to the seed. When None, the current
       PyTorch random number generator state will be used.
       Defaults to None.
   :param fixed_class_order: If not None, the class order to use (overrides
       the shuffle argument). Very useful for enhancing
       reproducibility. Defaults to None.
   :param per_step_classes: Is not None, a dictionary whose keys are
       (0-indexed) step IDs and their values are the number of classes
       to include in the respective steps. The dictionary doesn't
       have to contain a key for each step! All the remaining steps
       will contain an equal amount of the remaining classes. The
       remaining number of classes must be divisible without remainder
       by the remaining number of steps. For instance,
       if you want to include 50 classes in the first step
       while equally distributing remaining classes across remaining
       steps, just pass the "{0: 50}" dictionary as the
       per_step_classes parameter. Defaults to None.
   :param class_ids_from_zero_from_first_step: If True, original class IDs
       will be remapped so that they will appear as having an ascending
       order. For instance, if the resulting class order after shuffling
       (or defined by fixed_class_order) is [23, 34, 11, 7, 6, ...] and
       class_ids_from_zero_from_first_step is True, then all the patterns
       belonging to class 23 will appear as belonging to class "0",
       class "34" will be mapped to "1", class "11" to "2" and so on.
       This is very useful when drawing confusion matrices and when dealing
       with algorithms with dynamic head expansion. Defaults to False.
       Mutually exclusive with the ``class_ids_from_zero_in_each_step``
       parameter.
   :param class_ids_from_zero_in_each_step: If True, original class IDs
       will be mapped to range [0, n_classes_in_step) for each step.
       Defaults to False. Mutually exclusive with the
       ``class_ids_from_zero_from_first_step parameter``.
   :param reproducibility_data: If not None, overrides all the other
       scenario definition options. This is usually a dictionary containing
       data used to reproduce a specific experiment. One can use the
       ``get_reproducibility_data`` method to get (and even distribute)
       the experiment setup so that it can be loaded by passing it as this
       parameter. In this way one can be sure that the same specific
       experimental setup is being used (for reproducibility purposes).
       Beware that, in order to reproduce an experiment, the same train and
       test datasets must be used. Defaults to None.

.. py:class:: IStepInfo

   Bases: :class:`typing.Protocol`

   Definition of a learning step. A learning step contains a set of patterns
   which has become available at a particular time instant. The content and
   size of a Step is defined by the specific benchmark that creates the
   IStepInfo instance.

   For instance, a step of a New Classes scenario will contain all patterns
   belonging to a subset of classes of the original training set. A step of a
   New Instance scenario will contain patterns from previously seen classes.

   Steps of  Single Incremental Task (a.k.a. task-free) scenarios are usually
   called "batches" while in Multi Task scenarios a Step is usually associated
   to a "task". Finally, in a Multi Incremental Task scenario the Step may be
   composed by patterns from different tasks.

.. function:: create_multi_dataset_generic_scenario(train_dataset_list: Sequence[IDatasetWithTargets], test_dataset_list: Sequence[IDatasetWithTargets], task_labels: Sequence[int], complete_test_set_only: bool = False) -> GenericCLScenario

   Creates a generic scenario given a list of datasets and the respective task
   labels. Each training dataset will be considered as a separate training
   step. Contents of the datasets will not be changed, including the targets.

   When loading the datasets from a set of fixed filelist, consider using
   the :func:`create_generic_scenario_from_filelists` helper method instead.

   In its base form, this function accepts a list of test datsets that must
   contain the same amount of datasets of the training list.
   Those pairs are then used to create the "past", "cumulative"
   (a.k.a. growing) and "future" test sets. However, in certain Continual
   Learning scenarios only the concept of "complete" test set makes sense. In
   that case, the ``complete_test_set_only`` should be set to True (see the
   parameter description for more info).

   Beware that pattern transformations must already be included in the
   datasets (when needed).

   :param train_dataset_list: A list of training datasets.
   :param test_dataset_list: A list of test datasets.
   :param task_labels: A list of task labels. Must contain the same amount of
       elements of the ``train_dataset_list`` parameter. For
       Single-Incremental-Task (a.k.a. Task-Free) scenarios, this is usually
       a list of zeros. For Multi Task scenario, this is usually a list of
       ascending task labels (starting from 0).
   :param complete_test_set_only: If True, only the complete test set will
       be returned by the scenario. This means that the ``test_dataset_list``
       parameter must be list with a single element (the complete test set).
       Defaults to False, which means that ``train_dataset_list`` and
       ``test_dataset_list`` must contain the same amount of datasets.

   :returns: A :class:`GenericCLScenario` instance.


.. function:: create_generic_scenario_from_filelists(root: Union[str, Path], train_file_lists: Sequence[Union[str, Path]], test_file_lists: Union[Union[str, Path], Sequence[Union[str, Path]]], task_labels: Sequence[int], complete_test_set_only: bool = False, train_transform=None, train_target_transform=None, test_transform=None, test_target_transform=None) -> GenericCLScenario

   Creates a generic scenario given a list of filelists and the respective task
   labels. A separate dataset will be created for each filelist and each of
   those training datasets will be considered a separate training step.
   Contents of the datasets will not be changed, including the targets.

   In its base form, this function accepts a list of filelists for the test
   datsets that must contain the same amount of elements of the training list.
   Those pairs of datasets are then used to create the "past", "cumulative"
   (a.k.a. growing) and "future" test sets. However, in certain Continual
   Learning scenarios only the concept of "complete" test set makes sense. In
   that case, the ``complete_test_set_only`` should be set to True (see the
   parameter description for more info).

   This helper functions is the best shot when loading Caffe-style dataset
   based on filelists.

   :param root: The root path of the dataset.
   :param train_file_lists: A list of filelists describing the
       paths of the training patterns for each step.
   :param test_file_lists: A list of filelists describing the
       paths of the test patterns for each step.
   :param task_labels: A list of task labels. Must contain the same amount of
       elements of the ``train_file_lists`` parameter. For
       Single-Incremental-Task (a.k.a. Task-Free) scenarios, this is usually
       a list of zeros. For Multi Task scenario, this is usually a list of
       ascending task labels (starting from 0).
   :param complete_test_set_only: If True, only the complete test set will
       be returned by the scenario. This means that the ``test_file_lists``
       parameter must be list with a single element (the complete test set).
       Alternatively, can be a plain string or :class:`Path` object.
       Defaults to False, which means that ``train_file_lists`` and
       ``test_file_lists`` must contain the same amount of filelists paths.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to training patterns.
       Defaults to None.
   :param train_target_transform: The transformation to apply to training
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param test_transform: The transformation to apply to test patterns.
       Defaults to None.
   :param test_target_transform: The transformation to apply to test
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.

   Creates a generic scenario given lists of Tensors and the respective task
   labels. A separate dataset will be created from each Tensor pair (x + y)
   and each of those training datasets will be considered a separate
   training step. Contents of the datasets will not be changed, including the
   targets. Using this helper function is the lower level way to create a
   Continual Learning scenario. When possible, consider using higher level
   helpers.

   In its base form, the test lists must contain the same amount of elements of
   the training lists. Those pairs of datasets are then used to create the
   "past", "cumulative" (a.k.a. growing) and "future" test sets.
   However, in certain Continual Learning scenarios only the concept of
   "complete" test set makes sense. In that case, the
   ``complete_test_set_only`` should be set to True (see the parameter
   description for more info).

   :param train_data_x: A list of Tensors (one per step) containing the
       patterns of the training sets.
   :param train_data_y: A list of Tensors or int lists containing the
       labels of the patterns of the training sets. Must contain the same
       number of elements of ``train_datasets_x``.
   :param test_data_x: A Tensor or a list of Tensors (one per step) containing
       the patterns of the test sets.
   :param test_data_y: A Tensor or a list of Tensors or int lists containing
       the labels of the patterns of the test sets. Must contain the same
       number of elements of ``test_datasets_x``.
   :param task_labels: A list of task labels. Must contain the same amount of
       elements of the ``train_datasets_x`` parameter. For
       Single-Incremental-Task (a.k.a. Task-Free) scenarios, this is usually
       a list of zeros. For Multi Task scenario, this is usually a list of
       ascending task labels (starting from 0).
   :param complete_test_set_only: If True, only the complete test set will
       be returned by the scenario. This means that the ``test_datasets_x`` and
       ``test_datasets_y`` parameters must be lists with a single element
       (the complete test set). Defaults to False, which means that
       ``train_file_lists`` and ``test_file_lists`` must contain the same
       amount of filelists paths.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to training patterns.
       Defaults to None.
   :param train_target_transform: The transformation to apply to training
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param test_transform: The transformation to apply to test patterns.
       Defaults to None.
   :param test_target_transform: The transformation to apply to test
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
