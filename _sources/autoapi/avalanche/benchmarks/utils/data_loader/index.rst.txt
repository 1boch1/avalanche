.. py:class:: MultiTaskDataLoader(data_dict: Dict, oversample_small_tasks: bool = False, **kwargs)

   Custom data loader for multi-task training.
   The dictionary `data_dict` maps task ids into their
   corresponding datasets.

   When iterating over the data, it returns sequentially a different
   batch for each task (i.e. first a batch for task 1, then task 2,
   and so on). If `oversample_small_tasks == True` smaller tasks are
   oversampled to match the largest task.

   It is suggested to use this loader only if tasks have approximately the
   same length.

   :param data_dict: a dictionary with task ids as keys and Datasets
       as values.
   :param oversample_small_tasks: whether smaller tasks should be
       oversampled to match the largest one.
   :param kwargs: data loader arguments used to instantiate the loader for
       each task separately. See pytorch :class:`DataLoader`.

.. py:class:: MultiTaskMultiBatchDataLoader(data_dict: Dict, oversample_small_tasks: bool = False, **kwargs)

   Custom data loader for multi-task training.
   The dictionary `data_dict` maps task ids into their
   corresponding datasets.

   mini-batches emitted by this dataloader are dictionaries with task
   labels as keys and mini-batches as values. Therefore, each mini-batch
   contains separate data for each task (i.e. key 1 batch for task 1).
   If `oversample_small_tasks == True` smaller tasks are oversampled to
   match the largest task.

   It is suggested to use this loader only if tasks have approximately the
   same length.

   :param data_dict: a dictionary with task ids as keys and Datasets
       as values.
   :param oversample_small_task: whether smaller tasks should be
       oversampled to match the largest one.
   :param kwargs: data loader arguments used to instantiate the loader for
       each task separately. See pytorch :class:`DataLoader`.
